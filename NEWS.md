# simulariatools 3.0.0

## Breaking changes

- Deprecated functions `contourPlot()` and `createBaseMap()` have been
  removed.
- `downloadBasemap()` now returns a `tiff` file with `GeoTIFF` metadata,
  instead of `png`.

## New features

- `contourPlot2()` introduces new arguments `mask` and `inverse_mask`.
  These allow plotting data only inside (or outside) a polygon specified
  by a `shp` file.
- Labels in `plotAvgTemp()`, `plotStabilityClass()` and `plotAvgRad()`
  now respect the locale setting. The optional argument `locale` has
  also been added to override the system locale. Currently supported
  locales are Italian and English; unsupported locales are converted to
  English.
- `plotAvgRad()` now includes options to change the y-axis label and the
  title.

## Minor improvements and fixes

- `contourPlot2()` now masks content outside the plot domain.
  Previously, values outside plot domain were set to NA's, which could
  potentially cause artefacts at the borders.
- `contourPlot2()` has been updated to fix some breaking changes
  introduced by `ggplot2` since version 3.5.0 where `guide_legend()`
  only draws a key glyph for a layer when the value is in the layerâ€™s
  data.
- `contourPlot2()` now removes `-Inf` from the levels list (if present)
  when plotting only contour lines.
- In `plotAvgRad()`, a missing colour for average radiation in the
  legend has been fixed.
- In `plotAvgTemp()`, a missing colour for average temperature in the
  legend has been fixed.
- In `plotAvgTemp()`, a bug related to the name of the column with
  temperature data has been fixed.
- In `stabilityClass()`, the tables defining the stability class as
  functions of radiation, wind speed and cloud cover have been slightly
  updated.
- In `stabilityClass()` the `impact` method has been deprecated and
  renamed to `iaea`.
- In `plotStabilityClass()`, a bug where a missing class was not shown
  in the legend has been fixed.
- Almost all the dependencies from *Openair* have been removed.
- Other minor bugs have been fixed and documentation has been updated
  and hopefully improved.


# simulariatools 2.5.1

- Removed Unicode symbols (on CRAN request).
- Explicitly add x and y scales limits to `contourPlot2`.
- Updated deprecated functions from `scales` package.
- Bug fix: avoid `Inf` duplication in `contourPlot2` legend.
- Documentation: spell check and improvements.


# simulariatools 2.5.0

- Dependency from other packages has been reviewed. `RColorBrewer`,
  `dplyr` and `png` are not required any more.
- `raster` becomes suggested, since it is only required by the
  deprecated `contourPlot()` function. Geo processing is now performed
  by the required `terra` package.
- `Openair` is now a suggested package.
- Bugs were fixed in the Pasquill stability class functions
  `stabilityClass()` and `plotStabilityClass()`. Furthermore, some
  working examples have been added.
- In `contourPlot2()`, deprecation of `stat(level)` and `size` of
  `ggplot2()` have been fixed.
- Improved documentation and `README` file.


# simulariatools 2.4.0

- The package is ready to be submitted to CRAN.
- Fixed many syntax errors, cleaned up code to try to comply with best
  practices.
- Fixed warnings in the documentation and added some working examples in
  some functions.
- Added some tests.
- Added a sample dataset `stMeteo` with hourly values of wind speed,
  wind direction, temperature, global radiation, total cloud cover and
  stability class.
- Renamed `NEWS` to `NEWS.md`.
- Updated `README` file.


# simulariatools 2.3.1

- Trying to fix issues with fonts in `contourPlot2()`.
- Updated readme file and fixed some minor issues in the documentation.


# simulariatools 2.3.0

- BREAKING CHANGE: in raster plots in `contourPlot2` (tile = TRUE)
  intervals are closed on the left and open on the right. In previous
  versions it was the opposite. In this way an interval `0 - 1` does
  include values equal to 0 and does not include values equals to 1.


# simulariatools 2.2.3

- `magick` package is now suggested (not required). If it is not
  installed, it will not be possible to read (and plot) background base
  maps in `contourPlot2`.
- In `contourPlot2` do not add `Inf` as upper limit in levels in the
  case of delta maps, when the first level is negative. Note that this
  will probably change the output of some scripts.
- Vector field lengths are not normalised any more and changed default
  scale factor. This modification aims to facilitate comparison of
  vector fields from different source files.
- Updated readme and added a brief example.


# simulariatools 2.2.2

- Fixed labels of `contourPlot2` which occasionally were not properly
  formatted.


# simulariatools 2.2.1

- Minor update in the documentation.


# simulariatools 2.2.0

- Added boolean option `tile` to plot tiles instead of contours.


# simulariatools 2.1.1

- Fixed bug in `importRaster()`.


# simulariatools 2.1.0

## Breaking changes
  - `vectorField()` has now a unique parameter for scaling vector
    length;
  - Length of the arrow head in `vectorField()` has been removed in
    exchange for a sensible default;
- Bug fixes.


# simulariatools 2.0.0

## New features

- New `contourPlot2()` function:
- Based on *ggplot2* v3.3.0 and `geom_contour_filled` function;
- Colour bands are not overlapped any more therefore the maps are more
  accurate;
- Legend labels are more informative and smarter (you can also use +/-
  `Inf` for upper and lower bound);
- Legend type for contour lines (no filling) is now a line;
- Added possibility to specify column names to the data;
- Axis labels are rounded to 0 decimals (they are in metres);
- Background image can be any format (jpeg, png, etc.);
- Almost entirely a substitute of `contourPlot()`.
- New `downloadBasemap()` function to download base map from the Italian
  National Geoportal.

- `vectorField` has better defaults for vector lengths.
- Changed position of legend in `plotAvgRad()`.
- The package is now compliant with R cmd check (CRAN).
